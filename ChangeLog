2007-10-21  Martin Schwenke  <martin@meltin.net>

	* gnuclient.c, gnuslib.c: Merge this:

	2006-08-08  Jerry James  <james@xemacs.org>

		* gnuslib.c (disconnect_from_server): shutdown() has been fine on
		Linux for a long time now; use it.  Also, don't use length to
		access the buffer unless it is positive, not just nonzero.
		* gnuclient.c (filename_expand): Initialize the last array element
		to get a valid C string in case of overflow.  Use strncat to avoid
		buffer overruns.
		* gnuclient.c (main): Use strncpy to avoid buffer overruns.

	* gnuclient.c: Sync with xemacs-21.5.27.

	* gnuserv.c, sysfile.h, syssignal.h: Version from xemacs-21.5.27.

	Add eval-and-compile around a bunch of code to facilitate
